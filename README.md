# originlab-voltammetry-peaks
Python automation for OriginLab to automatically detect and calculate peak heights from voltammetry data Gammry devices, as an example here of Linear sweep voltammetry

## 🌟 Key Features

The script executes the following analysis steps for each voltammetry cycle:

* **Baseline Estimation:** Accurately estimates the electrochemical background current.
* **Peak Definition:** Automatically identifies the potential and current of the maximum peak.
* **Peak Height Calculation:** Calculates the true peak height relative to the estimated baseline.
* **Statistical Summary:** Computes the **mean** and **standard deviation (SD)** of peak heights from multi-cycle experiments.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates a clearly **illustrated graph** within OriginLab showing the detected peak and baseline.

## 📊 Input Data Format

The script is configured to process one or more **Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV)** raw data files (typically **\*.DTA** format) generated by a Gamry Potentiostat.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run this script successfully, you need:

### 1. OriginLab App Center Installation
You must install the **"Import Gamry Voltammetry Files"** App from the OriginLab **App Center**. This tool is required to correctly import the raw data format.

### 2. Python Package Installation
Install the necessary Python libraries directly within OriginLab's environment:
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `pandas`

> **How to Install:** In OriginLab, navigate to **Connectivity** $\rightarrow$ **Python Packages...** and search for and install the packages listed above.

### 3. Script Placement
Download the script file **`findpeak.py`** and place it in your OriginLab User Files directory:
`C:\Users\ <your_username> \Documents\OriginLab\User Files`

## ▶️ How to Run

Follow these steps to run the automation script in OriginLab:

1.  **Import Data:** Use the **"Import Gamry Voltammetry Files"** App to load your **\*.DTA** file(s) into OriginLab.
2.  **Open Command Window:** Press **`Alt + 3`** or navigate to **Window** $\rightarrow$ **Command Window**.
3.  **Execute Script:** In the Command Window, type the following command and press **Enter**:
    ```
    run -pyf findpeak.py
    ```
4.  **Define Baseline Range:** The script will prompt you in the Command Window to input the **Initial** and **Final Potential (in Volts, V)** that define the region used for **baseline estimation**.

## 📈 Output

Upon completion, the script generates the following analytical outputs directly within your OriginLab project:

* **Results Note:** A comprehensive note sheet containing:
    * Individual peak heights.
    * The **average** peak height across all cycles.
    * The **standard deviation (SD)** of the peak heights.
* **Illustrated Graph:** A new graph window visualizing the imported data, clearly marking the detected **peak position** ($E_p, I_p$) and the calculated **baseline** used for the measurement.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project serves as a robust example of integrating specialized Python analysis with the OriginLab environment.

* **Current Focus:** LSV peak calculation using embedded Python within OriginLab.
* **Scalability:** The framework is easily extensible and can be developed for automated analysis of other voltammetric techniques, including **Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)** and **Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV)**.
* **Portfolio:** A demonstration of automated scientific data processing capabilities.
